# Azure DevOps Demo Generator


## About

The Azure DevOps Demo Generator can create projects in your Azure DevOps organization, prepopulated with template-based content including source code, work items, iterations, service endpoints, build and release definitions, and more!

The original purpose of this system is to simplify working with the [Azure DevOps hands-on-labs](https://www.azuredevopslabs.com), demos and other education material. But it can also be used to drive your ownAzure DevOps automation utilities, provision your own custom templates, or as a reference for using the [Azure DevOps REST APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/).
